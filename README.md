# spotify-higher-lower

simple higher lower game, where you have to guess the track that is more popular.
you can choose your custom playlists to get the tracks that you want to play with.

because im too bad for the spotify api auth shit, you have to use the basic auth key provided in the spotify dev example on the main page https://developer.spotify.com
